# Resource Leak Checker (RLC#) for C# code using CodeQL

RLC# is a light-weight and modular resource leak checker for C# code. It is inspired by [Checker Framework's](https://checkerframework.org/) resource leak checker (RLC) for Java.
RLC# is developed as a CodeQL query.

## Prerequisites

- Install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you are using a Windows machine.
- Install [CodeQL CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-codeql-cli/getting-started-with-the-codeql-cli#checking-out-the-codeql-source-code-directly).

## How to use?

First download the CodeQL databases from LGTM and extract the database folders from the compressed files. You can also [create a CodeQL database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-codeql-cli/creating-codeql-databases).

Update the `HOME` variable in `run-all-services.sh` to provide path to the CodeQL repository that is cloned when you install CodeQL CLI.

To run RLC# on a list of CodeQL databases, run the following script with a list of paths to the CodeQL database folders.
```bash
./run-all-services.sh <list-of-codeql-databases>
```

For each database, a sub-directory is created inside results/rlc-warnings that contains a file named `rlc-i-all.csv`. The resource leak warnings generated by RLC# are listed in this file.
Each row in the file `rlc-i-all.csv` corresponds to a potential resource leak. The fifth column in a row gives the name of the source file in which the resource leak is detected and the sixth column gives the start line number. The third column provides meta information (type of resource, `L` stands for library type and `C` stands for custom type) for the resource leak warning.
